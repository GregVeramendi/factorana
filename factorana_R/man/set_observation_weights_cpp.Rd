\title{Set observation weights for weighted likelihood estimation}
\usage{
set_observation_weights_cpp(fm_ptr, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{fm_ptr}{External pointer to FactorModel object}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector of observation weights (length = n_obs)}
}
\description{
Sets per-observation weights for the likelihood calculation. When weights
are set, each observation's contribution to the log-likelihood is multiplied
by its weight. This is used for importance sampling in adaptive integration.
