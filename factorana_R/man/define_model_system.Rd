\usage{
define_model_system(components, factor, previous_stage = NULL, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{components}{A named list of model_component objects}

\item{factor}{A factor_model object}

\item{previous_stage}{Optional result from a previous estimation stage.
If provided, the previous stage components and parameters will be fixed
and prepended to the new components. This enables sequential/multi-stage
estimation where early stages are held fixed while later stages are optimized.}

\item{weights}{Optional. Name of a variable in the data containing observation weights.
When specified, each observation's contribution to the log-likelihood is multiplied
by its weight. Useful for survey weights, importance sampling, or giving different
observations different influence on the estimation. Weights should be positive.
The variable is extracted from the data passed to \code{estimate_model_rcpp()}.}
}
\value{
An object of class "model_system". A list of model_component objects and one factor_model object.
